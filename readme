This is an KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) web monitor for
printrun / pronterface written in PHP.

For webcam access it requires streamer from the following package:
 - xawtv

and v4l2 support in linux kernel.

For printrun querying it requires:
- php-xmlrpc

It can handle unlimited number of pronterface instances and webcams.

If you run webserver on different user than root (which you really
should), you may need to allow it access to V4L devices. In case
you run Apache as apache user, just adding apache to the video
group should do the trick:

# gpasswd -a apache video
# service httpd restart


SELinux
=======

In case you use SELinux it will require more tweaking. At first
you need to allow Apache processes to use network sockets:
# setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1

Next you need to make folder for images writeable by Apache.
Supposing that the images from the webcameras are stored in the
'img' folder (which is the default), the following commands will
create the folder and allow write operations on it:
# cd /var/www/html
# mkdir img data
# semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/html/data(/.*)?"
# semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/html/img(/.*)?"
# restorecon -Rv /var/www/html/*

Finally you need to create and enable SELinux module which will
allow Apache processes access to V4L devices. On Fedora the
following commands will do it:

# dnf install selinux-policy-devel
# cd /etc/selinux
# cat > apache_v4l.te  <<:EOF
module apache_v4l 1.0;

require {
  class chr_file { open read getattr write ioctl };
  type httpd_t;
  type v4l_device_t;
};

# Enable v4l devices access by apache
allow httpd_t v4l_device_t:chr_file { open read getattr write ioctl };
:EOF

# make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile apache_v4l.pp
# semodule -i apache_v4l.pp
